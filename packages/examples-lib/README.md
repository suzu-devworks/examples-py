## Standard library study

- [`datetime`](./tests/libraries/datetime/)
  > The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.

## Third party library study

- [`NumPy`](./tests/libraries/numpy/)
  >ã€€NumPy is a library that adds support for large multidimensional arrays and matrices, and a large collection of advanced mathematical functions for manipulating these arrays.

## Development

### How the project was initialized
